**Battle Royale!!!**

# Problem Description
  
You are playing solo's on Fortnite. You have landed in Tilted Towers and have found a crossbow, the most elite weaponry in the game. However,
  there are (N) enemies remaining and Epic Games has updated the game so that you have (A) amount of arrows instead of an unlimited amount. 
  Each enemy also has a given amount of health denoted by (H). Each arrow (A) may only deal one damage to the enemy's health (H).
  Of course like usual you can scavenge all of you enemies ammo and use it to kill the following (N-1) enemies. 
  You must figure out the minimum amount of arrows (A) you need to kill all (N) enemies.  



# Input

The very first line of input will start with an integer (T) denoting how many test cases will appear.

The first line of each test case will start with an integer (N) denoting how many enemies there are remaining. The following N lines will contain
integers (H) and (A) denoting the enemy's health and ammo respectively.

As a rule you must kill each enemy in the order you run into them. There is no running away or hiding in a bush until they pass. You're a Fortnite
Slayer and defeat each enemy you encounter.

$1 \leq T \leq 100$

$1 \leq H \leq 200$

$0 \leq A \leq 200$

# Output

Your output should consist simply of one line, the minimum amount of arrows you need to defeat 
all enemies and claim VICTORY ROYALE!!!
